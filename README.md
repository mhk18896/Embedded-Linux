## Project Overview
This project involves developing a custom hardware image accelerator and integrating it into a QEMU virtual board environment. The hardware will be interfaced with a Linux Kernel Module (LKM) and run within
 a custom-built image generated using the Yocto Project.

## Objective
The goal is to create a seamless pipeline where:

- The userspace application interacts with the virtual hardware.
- Data is sent from the userspace application to the image accelerator for processing.
- The processed image data is sent back to the userspace application for display or further use.

## Key Components
- Custom Hardware: A virtual hardware accelerator for image processing.
- QEMU Virtual Environment: Simulated hardware environment for development and testing.
- Linux Kernel Module (LKM): Serves as the interface between the custom hardware and the Linux operating system.
- Yocto Project: Used to build a minimal and tailored Linux image containing the necessary drivers and applications.
- Userspace Application: Acts as the front-end for sending image data to the hardware and displaying the processed output.

## Workflow

- Before diving into our workflow, itâ€™s essential to set up the working environment to ensure a seamless and efficient process without any disruptions. The two primary technologies we will be utilizing are:
- Yocto Project
- QEMU
   But Before starting our development process we will first make a seprate directory where we can organise our entire development procedure.
    ```bash
        mkdir project
         cd project

## Yocto Project
  - The Yocto Project is designed to enable the development of a Linux OS customized for specific embedded devices.
    It provides powerful tools that not only allow us to tailor Linux to meet our specific requirements but also support
    and streamline the entire development process.

   ### Setting up Yocto Project 
  -  The Yocto Project offers a wide range of capabilities, which are thoroughly documented in the Yocto Project manual. 
     The manual provides comprehensive and well-structured guidance. However, our focus here will
     be limited to aspects specifically related to our project.
     ```bash
       git clone https://github.com/yoctoproject/poky 
##  QEMU 
  - The main idea behind QEMU is to emulate virtual hardware for various architectures (e.g., ARM, RISC-V) different from the host architecture.
    For example, you can emulate an ARM processor along with its entire board on an x86 architecture. The advantage of using QEMU is that it enables quick prototyping of hardware behavior,
    reducing development and testing time. Additionally, it allows us to test our Linux OS on the hardware emulated by QEMU. 
    QEMU supports a wide range of architectures and boards, including Virt, Raspberry Pi, STM32, and many others.

###  Setting up QEMU
  - For setting up the enviroment of QEMU we will follow the folowing sequence of commands
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/qemu/qemu #this is local copy of the QEMU source code from github in our working directory
    #Now as we have to local repository of QEMU now we have to build it source source but before that we have to perform some configurations
    ./configure --help #here you can easily check which options you can select so that when you invoke 'make' command qemu will import all
                       the important stuff that will be used to emulate the QEMU machine.  
    ./configure --target-list=arm-softmmu,aarch64-softmmu --enable-slirp #all the softmmu option are used for system level emulation as we 
            are doing system level emulation and --enable-slirp is enabling the library as we are going to add ssh support for our machine
            which will be used for ssh connection.
    #after setting the configuration invoke command:
    make
